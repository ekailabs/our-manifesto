# Our Values

1. **Customer Obsession**  
   We are focused on solving our customers' problems using technology. Their challenges are our challenges; their wins are our wins.

2. **Ownership**  
   Every teammate acts proactively and takes responsibility beyond their defined roles, caring deeply about the company's success.

3. **Action-Oriented Mindset**  
   Prioritize decisive action, rapid iteration, and learning through user feedback rather than prolonged deliberation.

4. **Clear Communication**  
   Communicate openly and clearly, ensuring alignment, accountability, and mutual understanding across the team.

5. **Mission Over Ego**  
   Decisions and actions are driven by what serves Ekai's overall purpose and vision, not by personal gain or recognition.
